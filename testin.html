<p>While developing this site sometimes I had one of those "Oooh! That's cool! I want to build that!" ideas.
Here are a few of them. All of these are Html5/css/Javascript. I'll put them on my git so you can see the source. </p>

<h3>iPhone Style button</h3>
<p>This is a small slider button which has a simple toggle method attached to it in Javascript. It's almost entirely CSS/ Javascript/Jquery.</p>
 
 <link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='http://www.thedailynerd.com/css/ponbutton.css'>
 <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.thedailynerd.com/js/ponbutton.js"></script>
 	<div class="ponbutton">
		<div class="switch"></div>
		<div class="color1"></div>
		<div class="color2"></div>
		<div class="border"></div>
	</div>

<a href="https://github.com/fakeblankrounds/thedailynerd-website/blob/master/ponbutton.html">Source</a>
	
<h3> DailyNerd Background </h3>
<p>In the initial design of the daily nerd it was going to have a more news-papery type feel. I wanted to add something
that might make the page a little more interesting visually. I decided against it after realising that it just plain
didn't look that good. It's still cool and has some useful code. Especially if you need some rendering code for HTML5 Canvas/Javascript .
 </p>
<p>
I'm not going to in-line these just because they are kinda big and fairly resource intensive But here's a screenshot of 
the two variations that I made with links. 
</p>

<br><a href="posts/extras/htmlbg.html"> A more complex short path builder </a>

<p>These are all very simple trinkets. They serve no purpose except for a neat design and some cool factor. I was
going to use the button for my site but later decided that it was unnecessary and never got around to it.
</div><div class="oddPost"> <div class="BlogityBox"></div><a href="http://www.thedailynerd.com/?post=/posts/nodejsisgood.html"><h1>Node.js is Node.js. Not Cancer, and not Magic.</h1> </a>
-By Nick Tkachov
<p> So <a href="http://teddziuba.com/2011/10/node-js-is-cancer.html" >Ted Dziuba wrote an article on why node.js is terrible </a> arguing that "non-blocking io" still blocks and running a
cpu intensive loop is going to stall every other operation. </p>
<p> Then <a href="http://joshuakehn.com/2011/10/3/Diagnosis-No-Cancer.html">Joshua Kehn wrote an article </a> about how node.js is faster than PHP and python at running Dziuba's fibonacchi sequence. </p>
<p> They both missed the point.</p>
<p> Node.js isn't made for running cpu intensive applications inside a single thread. Node.js is good for quick operations that would normally require blocking calls or long operations that wait/spin/idle for a while.</p>
<p> I've written servers in Node.js and Java. Both of my servers run off a single EC2 node (I'm a dirt poor college student). My Java server powers Zombie Outbreak which requires loads of blocking IO
calls to all the hash tables that store user data. Zombie outbreak needs to be concurrent though. The back-end logic of the game requires that users be able to upload data while the server does checking,
management, and updating. However, whenever the server needs to update the hash tables with new data (such as a zombie infection), it has to block. This operation also makes calls to Amazons simpleDB 
which, if written in Node.js, could end up blocking connections and cause timeouts with the way the server currently handles these events. Structured differently though, Node.js might be a better choice
for this server than Java is.</p>
<p> This blog, however, is written in Node.js. Since each blog post is tiny and each request is fairly simple, Node.js is wonderful for something like this. Node is fast enough to serve each request
with enough gusto to not bring the entire blog down. For running simple operations that
don't tie up the server, Node makes my job a lot easier by avoiding thread concurrency and race conditions.In all fairness, there is no architectural need for Node.js with this blog, I just wanted to learn javascript and toy with Node. <p> 
<p> The other benefit of node.js, although I don't particularly use this feature, is that if you have a lot of downtime on certain operations (Think Thread.sleep()), Node.js may save you. 
No matter how hard you try, Spawning 400 threads waiting on some distant database, API, or long poll request to return a query is doom. Node solves this exact problem with their non-blocking IO formula.
Each Thread you have idling might not take up any CPU time but does take up memory and the overhead for spawning threads may start to slow you down. Node.js doesn't spawn threads or processes so if you have many idling threads waiting for network response Node.js might 
save you from having to manage a thread pool. </p>
<p> Given 100 programmers and 100 programs you will end up with 10,000 solutions. I'm not arguing that Node.js should be your breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Node.js is a tool. And like my shop teacher said: "Use the right 
tool for the job. Anything else is a waste of time". Use your head when building your websites. And if you don't like Node.js don't use it.</p>

<p><b>tl;dr: Node is good for long, idleing requests and short quick requests. If you don't like it, don't use it. </b></p></div><div class="evenPost"><div class="BlogityBox"></div><h1>Zombie Outbreak will be rolling out this week</h1>
<p>Zombie Outbreak is an app I was working on the summer. I'm going to be rolling out the app slowly over the next couple of weeks because the app and this site run off the same server. 
I publish under the name Fake Blank Rounds. Unfortunatly someone else came out with an app called Outbreak! Zombies, thats not mine.
The app is currently not available on the android market but I will update this post with a link once it is. </p>
</div><div class="oddPost"> <div class="BlogityBox"></div><h1> Daily Nerd Tech Stack </h1>
<p>thedailynerd.com was built entirely from the ground up using 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nodejs.org">Node.js</a></li>
<li> HTML</li>
<li> CSS</li>
<li> Javascript</li>
</ul>
On top of Amazon's EC2 platform. Node handles everything from generating any search results (which includes the front page, as a request to index.html results in a search query for posts 1-10), to serving css and javascript files in the background.On boot, the server will access our Amazon S3 bucket and automatically pull its template files and parse them. Any requests made for any files from the server automatically hit the S3 bucket if the server doesn&#x2019;t find them already loaded in memory. Though it will load any files that are hit into memory as soon as it retrieves 
them from S3 so further requests for a file will always hit memory instead of S3. </p>
<p>
Inside node  our site is equipped to handle a few different requests.
<ul>
<li> &#x201c;?num=#:#&#x201d; request (where &#x2018;#&#x2019; is a number) will return the posts in order from the first number to the second number(newest to oldest). If the first number is larger than the second number it will return all the posts in reverse order (oldest to newest).</li>
<li> &#x201c;?post=posts/<name>.html&#x201d; will return a post that is located in that path. All posts come from memory as dictated by a &#x201c;posts.xml&#x201d; file on the server. So it will only pull known files from the server.</li>
<li> &#x201c;?where=tag&#x201d; will return any posts marked with what ever tag is requested. Simple as that. If I mark a post &#x201c;funny&#x201d; &#x201c;?where=funny&#x201d; will return that post (and any other posts i marked funny).</li>
<li>&#x201d;?tags=post/<name>.html&#x201d; will return the tags for a given post. It&#x2019;s not particularly useful at the moment and I haven&#x2019;t implemented them into site yet but hopefully they will eventually show (maybe in a popup) what a given post is tagged</li>
</ul>
That&#x2019;s about it for this site. More features will come with time as I develop the engine that powers it. I will update this post with a github link to the source of the entire engine so that anyone can use it. </p>

<br>
<p> Edit: I uploaded the server to the git. https://github.com/fakeblankrounds/thedailynerd-webserver . Enjoy!</p></div><div class="evenPost"><div class="BlogityBox"></div><h3> How many CS upperclassmen does it take to help a freshman with his C++ homework </h3>
