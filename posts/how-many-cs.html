<h3> How many CS upperclassmen does it take to help a freshman with his C++ homework </h3>
<p> Apperantly five: 1 to google the error, 2 to discuss the downfalls of C++, and 2 to try to
teach him gbd. He ended up solving his problem on his own becuase they gave up after they saw he named
half his variables "bottom" and another one "hombre".</p>
