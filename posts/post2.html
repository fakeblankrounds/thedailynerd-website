<h1>Time Keeps on Slippin'</h1>
<p>Okay, I like a challenge. We're rescuing ya. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.</p>
<p>Is that a cooking show? I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Who are you, my warranty?!</p>
<ul>
<li>Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.</li>
<li>You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?</li>
<li>You mean while I'm sleeping in it?</li>
<li>Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why would a robot need to drink? I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! I love you, buddy!</p>
<p>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Yes! In your face, Gandhi! I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Do a flip!</p>
<ol>
<li>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</li>
<li>Yes! In your face, Gandhi!</li>
<li>Bender, you risked your life to save me!</li>
</ol>
<p>I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh&hellip; also, comes with double prize money. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!</p>
